# Accessibility Report

## Principles of Universal Design

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our program provides indicators for whether a recipe is alcoholic or non-alcoholic shown on the instruction page. 
This ensures users who are underage or cannot consume alcohol for health reasons can easily identify suitable recipes. 
Additionally, we allow users to set ingredient preferences upon signup, which helps avoid recipes containing allergens.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
We offer features such as search functionality (by name or ingredient) and filters on the homepage. 
This allows users to interact with the program in ways that suit their preferences or current needs. 
Users can also draft and share their own recipes, catering to both casual users and more advanced cocktail enthusiasts.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The program is designed with clear images and detailed instructions for every recipe, making it accessible to users of varying levels of experience in cocktail-making. 
Features like bookmarking favorite recipes also make it easy for users to quickly access their preferred recipes.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
By including visual indicators (such as icons or text) for whether a recipe contains alcohol, the program ensures critical information is easily perceivable. 
We also use images to visually represent each cocktail, providing an additional layer of understanding for users.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
For each searching pages, users have to option to use the back button to search again if they type/click something wrong.
The searching pages inlcude the search by keywords and explore by ingredient. 

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
Users can navigate through recipes, filters, and features with minimal interaction (mouse click). 
Also, the bookmarking feature reduces the effort needed to repeatedly search for commonly used recipes.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
This principle could be further enhanced by optimizing the interface for accessibility tools like screen readers.
And also, it could be further developed for mobile users to access it.

## Target Audience (Who we would market our program towards)
Our program is designed for users interested in making and experimenting with cocktails at home. 
This includes amateurs, bartenders, and anyone who enjoys creating and sharing unique recipes. 
Users benefit from the program’s detailed instructions, visual aids, and the ability to search or filter recipes based on available ingredients or personal preferences.

## Accessibility Challenges
While our program provides many thoughts for people with accessibility issue, there are groups who still face challenges using it:
1. **Underage or Elderly Users**: Users who cannot or should not consume alcohol due to age or health restrictions may find limited value in recipes that contain alcohol. However, we mitigate this by providing non-alcoholic options and plan to further enhance this feature by asking for the user’s age during signup.
2. **Users with Visual Impairments**: Blind people may face challenges as the program heavily relies on visual elements. Integrating support for screen readers in the future could make the program more accessible to this demographic.

## Planned Enhancements
- **Age-based Filtering**: During the signup process, users will be asked their age. Based on their input, the program will only display non-alcoholic drinks for users below the legal drinking age or above a certain age threshold so that it could be much clearer for them to view the program.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: In the future, we aim to add compatibility for screen readers, making the program more accessible to users with visual impairments.
